# The Big Day To Do List 
An app for Brides and Grooms with a big list of things to do for their big day!

## Introduction
This simple to do list application was a project built as part of a 15-week full-stack web development course. 

## Technologies
This app is made with JavaScript, React, Bootstrap and axios to link it to the back end database in AWS Lambda. 

## Features
The Big Day To Do List lets you add in a task. If it's urgent you can toggle it so. Urgent items are signaled with a simple '!' in the lists.

The to do list title includes a dynamic number based on how many items are in that list. This list lets you either mark the item as complete, or delete the item if it's no longer required. 

When you delete a list item it is removed from the database.

When you mark as complete, the item will list in the completed list which is ordered from newest completed to oldest completed. When this list reaches 7 the oldest list items will be removed.

## Sources
This project was built on a 15-week full stack web development course delivered by Tech Returners.

## This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
